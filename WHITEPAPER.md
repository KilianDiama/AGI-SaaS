AGI-SaaS: A Modular Core Architecture for General-Purpose AI Systems
1. Introduction
The pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) remains one of the most ambitious frontiers in artificial intelligence. Despite the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), most systems today are limited to narrow tasks, lacking adaptability, reusability, and composability.

AGI-SaaS proposes a new open-source approach: a modular cognitive core designed to serve as the foundation for building intelligent systems that can reason, adapt, and evolve. It targets developers, researchers, and SaaS builders aiming to create systems that go beyond prompt-response patterns and into flexible, agentic intelligence.

This paper presents AGI-SaaS as a functional implementation of a modular AGI engine, bridging the gap between scientific theory and practical tooling.

2. Context and Motivation
While tools like LangChain, AutoGPT, and BabyAGI have popularized LLM agents, they generally fall into three major limitations:

Lack of true modular cognitive architecture (monolithic or hard-coded workflows)

Tight coupling to specific models (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

Poor support for production-ready API layers

Meanwhile, cognitive architectures from academic research (SOAR, ACT-R, etc.) are too abstract or impractical for modern LLM-based workflows.

AGI-SaaS addresses this gap by introducing:

A central execution kernel (the ‚Äúcognitive core‚Äù)

A modular plugin system for cognitive capabilities (perception, memory, ethics, etc.)

A dispatcher layer abstracting away model-specific logic

A FastAPI web interface for SaaS-level integration

A royalty-based license (0.8%) for sustainable development

3. Core Architecture Overview
AGI-SaaS is structured around the following key components:

üß† Core Kernel (noyau_core.py)
Acts as the system‚Äôs brain.

Loads and coordinates cognitive plugins.

Orchestrates the processing pipeline and manages message flow.

üß© Plugin System
Each plugin is a cognitive module (e.g. ethical control, memory integration).

Loaded dynamically, easy to extend, replace or disable.

Organized in /plugins and initialized automatically.

üîÄ Dispatcher Layer
Routes user input or context to the most appropriate LLM or tool.

Supports dynamic LLM selection via OpenRouter or similar services.

Encourages multi-agent or multi-model reasoning strategies.

üåê FastAPI Web Interface
Exposes endpoints like /think, /plan, /status.

Enables frontend/backend integration or use in SaaS products.

Makes the system accessible for external requests and real-time usage.

üöÄ Launcher
Entry point script (launcher.py) for environment setup and server initialization.

Optimized for local development and deployment.

Together, these layers provide a flexible, testable, and extendable base for cognitive agents, assistants, or general-purpose reasoning systems.

4. Plugin Architecture & Cognitive Mapping
The plugin system in AGI-SaaS is inspired by modular theories of cognition, where intelligence arises from a set of specialized, interacting subsystems. In practice, each plugin is a standalone Python module that represents a specific cognitive task or function.

üîß How it works:
Plugins are discovered and loaded dynamically at runtime.

They all implement a common method signature (e.g., analyze(message)).

The core sends user input to each plugin in parallel or sequence.

Plugin outputs are merged by a fusion layer (fusion_reponses).

üß† Example cognitive plugins:
Plugin	Simulated Cognitive Role
analyse_cognitive.py	Perception / contextual analysis
controle_ethique.py	Moral filtering / ethical guardrails
dispatcher_llm.py	Reasoning delegation (executive control)
fusion_reponses.py	Associative cortex / response synthesis
analysis_feedback.py	Short-term learning / self-correction

This architecture allows experimentation with custom modules for long-term memory, planning, tool usage, or emotional reasoning.

üîÅ Processing Pipeline
The default thinking process follows this sequence:

Input is received via /think

Each active plugin processes the input

Outputs are collected, weighted, and merged

A final response is returned

This pipeline enables a distributed cognitive system that can be customized and scaled depending on the complexity of the agent.

5. LLM Dispatcher & Cognitive Independence
AGI-SaaS introduces a dispatcher layer that abstracts interactions with LLM providers. This is critical for ensuring cognitive independence ‚Äî the ability to reason, plan, or generate responses using various models depending on the task or context.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features:
Supports services like OpenAI, Anthropic, and OpenRouter

Allows dynamic switching between models per request

Makes the system LLM-agnostic and future-proof

Instead of tying cognition to a single provider, the dispatcher evaluates the task (via metadata, plugin logic, or message content) and chooses the most appropriate LLM or tool. This enables multi-agent logic, fallback mechanisms, and cross-model ensemble reasoning.

By decoupling logic from model implementation, AGI-SaaS mirrors the adaptability of human cognition, which flexibly recruits different cognitive functions depending on the situation.

6. Memory & Planning (Future Integration)
AGI-SaaS is designed to integrate with memory systems and planning agents, forming the core of a long-term adaptive intelligence.

üß† Memory:
Planned integrations include:

Vector stores (Pinecone, ChromaDB, Weaviate)

Symbolic storage (structured thoughts, decisions)

Session and user context persistence

This would enable:

Recall of past interactions

Personalization

Progressive knowledge accumulation

üß≠ Planning:
While basic message processing exists, AGI-SaaS can be extended with:

Goal tracking

Action selection

Task decomposition

Tool execution (via ReAct, AutoGPT-style plugins)

This moves the system from a reactive assistant to a goal-directed agent, a core component of general intelligence.

7. Use Cases & Applications
AGI-SaaS can be used in both experimental and production settings. Possible applications include:

üî¨ Research / Experimentation
Cognitive agent simulation

Testing AGI hypotheses

Comparative model studies (LLM performance under same plugin logic)

üíº SaaS / Product Integration
AI copilots

Multimodal reasoning engines

Personalized conversational agents with memory and ethics

Autonomous assistants with specific plugin stacks

üõ†Ô∏è Developer Tools
Educational AGI playgrounds

Plugin marketplaces (e.g., ethical filters, long-term memory)

Bootstrapping agent-based workflows

The project is particularly suited for building customizable AGI agents with domain-specific behaviors, modular intelligence layers, and full API access.

8. Limitations & Future Work
While AGI-SaaS offers a solid foundation, it is not a complete AGI system. Known limitations include:

No long-term memory out-of-the-box

No built-in planning engine (yet)

Limited learning mechanisms (no reinforcement or gradient-based updates)

Requires manual plugin design (currently no plugin auto-generation)

Centralized decision fusion (not yet distributed cognition)

Future plans include:

Native vector memory modules

Plugin orchestration layers (planning, feedback loops)

Plugin metadata and auto-loading

Integration with voice, tools, and sensors

Multi-agent parallel reasoning (agent swarms)

9. Conclusion
AGI-SaaS presents a novel, modular architecture for general-purpose AI systems. It blends practical engineering with cognitive science inspiration to offer a scalable, extensible foundation for AGI experimentation and deployment.

Where many LLM frameworks focus on specific tasks or pipelines, AGI-SaaS takes a holistic approach: defining a system where intelligence emerges from interacting cognitive modules, decoupled from any single model or provider.

With its open-source foundation and royalty-backed license (0.8%), AGI-SaaS also introduces a sustainable path for open innovation, allowing creators to retain control while fostering growth.

Whether you are building a SaaS product, prototyping AGI architectures, or exploring next-gen assistants, AGI-SaaS offers the tools ‚Äî and the mindset ‚Äî to move from LLM-as-a-service to intelligence-as-a-system.
